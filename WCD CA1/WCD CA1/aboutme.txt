Hello! My name is Aaron Poh and I'm currently a year 1 student at Singapore Polytechnic pursuing a diploma on Infocomm Security Management, and previously studied in Yuan Ching Secondary School and Shuqun Primary School.

During my spare time, I like to program, do sports, play video games and listen to music. Some of the programming languages i did before are Java, Python and C. For sports, i usually cycle or play badminton. One of the sports I spent most of my time is probably badminton, and I would play it with my friends almost every weekend.

While in my secondary school days, some of the subjects that I chose for my subject combination in secondary school is A-Maths and Pure physics and chemistry. Out of all the subjects, one of my favourite subjects would be Mathematics. I enjoyed Mathematics as I like playing with numbers. Math is also used in the real world like telling time and even in some careers like programmers, computer engineers and infact, every other job out there. For these reasons, math is my favorite subject. 

As for the course I am currently in right now, Infocomm Security Management, I decided to study in this course as i have great interest in programming and security related things. Another reason is also because of the rise of jobs in the I.T. and internet security sector, and I thought that taking this course will help me in finding jobs that are suitable for me in the future.
